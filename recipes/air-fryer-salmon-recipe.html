    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Today we go back to the air fryer and show you our salmon air fryer
      recipe! This recipe works with any fish, not only salmon. But salmon
      especially turns out great this way. We use a Ninja Foodi Two Basket air
      fryer but all you need is an air fryer, some fish, and a few ingredients.
      Enjoy :)
    </p>

    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Warm up your air fryer for at least two minutes at 400F.</li>
      <li>
        Coat both sides of your fish with coconut oil, lemon pepper, dill, and
        grated lemon rind. If you have time, let it stand for an hour. It is ok
        either way.
      </li>
      <li>
        Dip a paper towel in a little bit of coconut oil and spread it on the
        air fryer baskets. We do this so it doesn't stick when done cooking.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place your fish in the air fryer and cook at 400F for 7 minutes. No need
        for flipping.
      </li>
      <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
