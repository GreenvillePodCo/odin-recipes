    <p>
      Today we go back to the air fryer and show you our salmon air fryer
      recipe! This recipe works with any fish, not only salmon. But salmon
      especially turns out great this way. We use a Ninja Foodi Two Basket air
      fryer but all you need is an air fryer, some fish, and a few ingredients.
      Enjoy :)
