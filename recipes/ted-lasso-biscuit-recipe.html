    <p>
      One of our favorite TV shows is Ted Lasso on Apple TV+. We’re watching
      season 2 week by week and had an epiphany: we should make the Ted Lasso
      biscuit recipe for our channel! Join Magda and Nathaniel as they show you
      how to make this quick, yummy, and buttery biscuit Ted Lasso style! Go
      watch Ted Lasso and munch on these shortcakes because you’ll love them and
      you’ll feel like Ted Lasso himself (or Rebecca).
